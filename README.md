Saba's 2018 RSI project regarding intrinsically linked graphs. 
 
The code relies on user input regarding crossing properties, i.e. the sign of the crossing and the pair of vertices in the edges that cross, in order to generate all linking numbers from pairs of disjoint cycles of a complete graph. The intent of the program is to determine whether embeddings of k7, k8, and k9 possess links of linking number at least 2.
